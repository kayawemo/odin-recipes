    <h2>Chicken Apple Sausage</h2>
    <h3>Ingredents</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>4 links chicken and apple sausage</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>3 cups apple cider or apple juice</li>
        <li>1 pound small Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed but not peeled</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly oil a baking pan.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, carefully cut a large pocket in each chicken breast. (Hint: Cutting close to the smooth <br>
            side of the breast ensures no holes in the chicken.) Place 1 half-slice of provolone inside each chicken,<br>
            followed by half of the apple slices, and a small amount of shallot or onion, to suit your tastes. Top with <br>
            the remaining half slice of provolone. Pull the chicken back together, sprinkle with a small amount of milk, <br>
            and coat with breadcrumbs. Place stuffed breasts on baking pan.

        </li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until no longer pink, and juices run clear.</li>
        <li>While the chicken bakes, you may start your sauce. In a double boiler over lightly simmering water, combine <br>
            the egg yolks and sugar. Beat until the yolk lightens and froth forms. Slowly add the wine, stirring <br>
            constantly, until the sauce thickens. Remove from the heat and stir in the pecans and vanilla. The sauce <br>
            looks nice served under the chicken with a small amount drizzled over it.While the chicken bakes, you may <br>
